# Bootcamp code refactor for accessibility project

## Description

I was asked to optimise and refactor the code in this project in order to improve the accessibility of the website. Web accessibility is vital for several reasons, the most important being it ensures that people with disabilities can access websites using assisstive technologies such as screen readers, video captions and braille keyboards. Optimising website accessibility can also be beneficial for businesses as it can improve search engine optimisation, and also help businesses avoid litigation that can occur when disabled users can not access their website.

I improved the accessibility of the website through the inclusion of semantic html and alt text to describe images.
