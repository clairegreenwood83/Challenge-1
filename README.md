# Bootcamp code refactor for accessibility project

## Description

I was asked to optimise and refactor the code in this project in order to improve the accessibility of the website the code deploys to. Web accessibility is vital for several reasons, the most important being it ensures that people with disabilities can access websites using assisstive technologies such as screen readers, video captions and braille keyboards. Optimising website accessibility can also be beneficial for businesses as it can improve search engine optimisation, and also help businesses avoid litigation that can occur when disabled users can not access their website. The refactoring will not change the styling of the webpage only the underlying code. 

### Tasks completed

* HTML elements replaced with semantic HTML elements
* alt text added to images
* Redundant classes were consolidated 
* Comments were added to the HTML and CSS
* The CSS was reorganised to a more logical structure
